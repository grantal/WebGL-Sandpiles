### Running Locally

You may be able to just open the `index.html` file in your browser. If you see just the highlights window and a black screeen, you'll need to run a server. One way to do that, if you have python installed, is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on mac and linux and `python -m http.server` on windows and go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.
You can learn more about this method [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)
